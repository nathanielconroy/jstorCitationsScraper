# jstorCitationsScraper
This is a very short python script for scraping the number of results from a series of jstor searches. I built this in order to track the volume of citations of American novels on metacanon.org.

In order for this script to work you will need the requests and bs4 python libraries.

This application is no longer functional as JSTOR has begun to block automated requests.
