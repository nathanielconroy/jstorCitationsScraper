# jstorCitationsScraper
This is a very short python script for scraping the number of results from a series of jstor searches. I built this in order to track the volume of citations of American novels on metacanon.org.

In order for this script to work you will need the requests and bs4 python libraries.

You will also need to place your search URLs into a file called 'jstorurls.txt'. I usually build this file using a php script, but you could just as easily do it with python. In a future version of this script, I may add a feature that allows you to build the URLs automatically from a list of search terms.
